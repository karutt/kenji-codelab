Choose a Gothic (sans-serif) font that is easy to read even from a distance. Canva provides several Gothic fonts by default, such as `Noto Sans JP`, `BIZ UDPGothic`, and `M1 Plus + 1p`. For this example, we'll use `Noto Sans JP`. To set the font, select your text, click the font property, type `Noto Sans JP` in the search box, and select it.

For text size, use the presets to keep your slides consistent (e.g., `12px`, `18px`, `24px`, `32px`, `64px`, etc.). You can view the presets by double-clicking the font size property.
