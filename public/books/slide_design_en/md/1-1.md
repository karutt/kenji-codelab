# Placing Objects

Canva provides four main types of objects you can place on your slides. Each has a shortcut key, which is convenient to remember.

| Object        | Shortcut Key |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| Add Text      | T            |
| Add Rectangle | R            |
| Add Circle    | C            |
| Add Line      | L            |

Note: When using shortcut keys, make sure no object is currently selected. If an object is focused, the shortcut may not work.

## Placing Text

Let's try placing some text. Use the T shortcut to add text as shown below.

Introduction to
Presentations for Papers
```

## Text Properties

When creating presentation slides for academic papers, keep the following points in mind regarding text properties (font, size, color, alignment, etc.):

-   **Use Gothic-style fonts**: Choose a Gothic (sans-serif) font that is easy to read from a distance.
-   **Use preset sizes**: Use Canva's preset sizes to maintain consistency throughout your slides.
-   **Align left or center**: For readability, left alignment is standard. For titles or slides with little text, consider center alignment.
