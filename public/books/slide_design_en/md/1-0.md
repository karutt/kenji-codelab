# Creating a Blank Presentation

This assumes you have access to Canva. First, open the Canva home screen and create a new presentation.

# Using Folders

Files and folders can be thought of as:

-   **Files**: Data such as images, documents, or videos
-   **Folders**: Containers for organizing files

In Canva, files are called "designs." For example, posters, presentation materials, and social media images are all considered designs (files). You can organize them into folders such as "School Projects" or "Personal Designs."

You can view your created files (hereafter referred to as designs) from the left sidebar under "Projects" → "Designs."

# Creating a Folder

To create a new folder, go to "Folders" → "Add New" → "Folder."

Name the folder "Slide Practice."

Once the folder is created, you can create files (presentation files) within it. Saving files in folders makes them easier to manage.

Click "Slide Practice (Folder)" → "Create Design" → "Presentation" to create a file within the folder. Name the file "Thesis Presentation Materials."
