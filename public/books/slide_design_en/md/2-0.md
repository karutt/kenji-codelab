# Basics of Layout

There are three basic layout principles for slide presentations:

- **Align positions**: Choose left, center, or right alignment horizontally, and top, center, or bottom alignment vertically.
- **Distribute evenly**: Arrange multiple objects evenly to balance the overall slide.
- **Add margins**: Adjust margins at the edges of slides, between objects, and line spacing to make your slides easy to read.
