# Using Figures and Graphs

In addition to text, using figures and graphs in your slides helps convey information visually. For academic presentations, avoid flashy artwork or graphics and use simple, easy-to-understand figures and graphs. As you have learned, the basic rule is to use a white background, black text, a standard sans-serif font, and minimal color.

However, you may still need to use photos, data graphs, or diagrams to visualize complex structures. When doing so, keep in mind that these are for academic presentations and design your slides accordingly.
