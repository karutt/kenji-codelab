# The Impact of SNS Use on High School Students' Communication

~Focusing on LINE and Twitter~

## 1. Introduction

In modern times, with the widespread use of smartphones, SNS platforms like LINE and Twitter have become essential tools for high school students' daily lives and communication. According to a recent report by the National Institution for Youth Education, over 90% of Japanese high school students use SNS, the highest among four countries surveyed. LINE is mainly used for communication among friends, while Twitter is used for gathering information and expressing opinions.

The aim of this study is to clarify how SNS use affects face-to-face communication and relationships among high school students. It also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of SNS use and proposes recommendations for healthy usage.

## 2. Research Methods

This study collected data using the following two methods:

### 2.1 Questionnaire Survey

A questionnaire was conducted with 1,000 third-year students from 35 high schools in Tokyo. The survey asked about SNS usage time, purposes, actual use of LINE and Twitter, and the frequency of face-to-face communication. The survey items were designed with reference to previous studies and the National Institution for Youth Education's report.

### 2.2 Individual Interviews

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 randomly selected respondents from the questionnaire. The interviews explored changes in friendships due to SNS use, the pros and cons of face-to-face communication, and experiences with trouble on SNS, providing qualitative data to supplement the survey.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Questionnaire Results

- **Usage Time and Frequency**  
  On weekdays, most students used SNS for 1–2 hours, with slightly longer use on weekends. Nearly all students used LINE daily for communication. About 70% used Twitter mainly for gathering information and expressing opinions.

- **Impact on Face-to-Face Communication**  
  The survey found that SNS use did not significantly change the frequency of face-to-face communication, but many students reported positive effects such as faster exchanges and broader information sharing. On the other hand, some pointed out that emotions are hard to convey through text, which can lead to misunderstandings.

### 3.2 Interview Results

Many interviewees said that group chats and timeline exchanges on SNS helped them meet new friends and connect with people who share their interests. However, since facial expressions and tone of voice are not conveyed online, misunderstandings and trouble can occur. Some participants noted the need to improve SNS literacy.

## 4. Discussion

The results of this study suggest the following points:

1. **Expansion of Communication Diversity**  
   SNS is an effective tool for quick and broad information exchange in addition to traditional face-to-face communication. Daily communication via LINE and information sharing via Twitter help high school students expand their relationships and share hobbies.

2. **Risk of Misunderstandings and Need for Countermeasures**  
   Text-based communication lacks nonverbal cues, increasing the risk of unintended misunderstandings. Interviews highlighted the importance of using stickers, emojis, or following up in person to accurately convey feelings and intentions.

3. **Different Purposes Affect Impact**  
   The impact of SNS use on face-to-face communication varies depending on the purpose (e.g., gathering information, sharing hobbies, contacting friends). For information gathering or sharing hobbies, SNS complements face-to-face interaction. When the main purpose is expressing emotions, the risk of misunderstandings increases.

These results show that SNS use has both positive and negative effects on high school students' communication. To use SNS healthily, users should improve their information literacy and be mindful of balancing online and face-to-face communication.

## 5. Conclusion

This study clarified that SNS platforms like LINE and Twitter play a major role in daily communication and information exchange among high school students, and that their use has some impact on face-to-face communication. While SNS use offers benefits such as expanding friendships and sharing hobbies, it also carries risks of misunderstandings and trouble. Going forward, it is important to promote healthy SNS use through information literacy education at school and at home.
