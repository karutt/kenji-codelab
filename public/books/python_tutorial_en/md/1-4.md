## Overview and Goals

The final goal is to complete an "**Automatic Attendance System**."  
Through this project, you'll experience the basics of information processing and the role of programming.

## Review So Far

So far, we've simulated the steps of the "Automatic Attendance System" in class and used workflows to express its logic precisely. Up to now, we've used "natural language"—the language we use every day—to describe this logic. From here, we'll implement this logic using the programming language "Python."

In the coming lessons, you'll first learn the basic grammar and concepts of Python and take your first steps into programming. Then, you'll learn more advanced techniques like functions and file handling, and gradually build something that looks and works like a real system. Finally, you'll use QR code reading and image processing to complete a working automatic attendance system. Enjoy the excitement of turning your ideas into reality!

## Learning Steps

### Basics

1. **Basic Syntax (Variables & Data Types)**

    - Learn how to work with strings, numbers, lists, and more.

2. **Control Structures (Conditionals & Loops)**
    - Use `if` statements and `for`/`while` loops to control the flow of your program.

### Applied

3. **Functions & Modules**

    - Learn how to group code into reusable pieces and use modules—skills that are useful even in team development.

4. **File Handling (CSV & Spreadsheets)**
    - Learn how to save and read attendance data, and how to work with external data.

### Practical

5. **QR Code Reading & Image Processing**

    - Learn how to actually read QR codes and import attendance information.

6. **System Integration & Completion**
    - Combine everything you've learned to finish your own automatic attendance system.
