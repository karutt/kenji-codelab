## Overview and Goals

The final goal is to complete an "Automatic Attendance System."  
Through this project, you'll experience the basics of information processing and the role of programming.

## Review So Far

So far, we've organized the workflow of the "Automatic Attendance System" in class, expressing the flow logically using natural language (Japanese).

But to turn ideas and logic into a working system, we need a language the computer can understand. From here, we'll use the programming language "Python" to implement the logic we've learned.

In the coming lessons, you'll first learn the basics of Python syntax and thinking, taking your first steps into programming. Then, you'll learn advanced techniques like functions and file operations, gradually building a real "system." Finally, you'll use QR code reading and libraries to complete a working "Automatic Attendance System."

Experience the fun of seeing your ideas come to life and actually work as code!

## Learning Steps

### Basics

1. **Basic Syntax (Variables & Data Types)**

    - Learn how to handle strings, numbers, lists, etc.

2. **Control Structures (Conditionals & Loops)**
    - Use `if` statements and `for`/`while` to control program flow.

### Advanced

3. **Functions & Modules**

    - Learn how to group and reuse code, which is also useful for team development.

4. **File Operations (CSV & Spreadsheets)**
    - Learn how to save and read attendance data, connecting with external data.

### Practice

5. **QR Code Reading & Libraries**

    - Learn how to read QR codes and import attendance info.

6. **System Integration & Completion**
    - Combine everything you've learned to finish the "Automatic Attendance System."
