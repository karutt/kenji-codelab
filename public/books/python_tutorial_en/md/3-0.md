## Overview of Python Advanced Topics

Let's use the knowledge of variables, operators, if statements, and for loops you learned in the basics to make more practical programs. In the advanced section, you'll learn new techniques through a project to create an attendance book program.

1. **How to Use Functions**

    - **Overview**: Writing the same process over and over is hard. With "functions," you can give a name to a process and reuse it as many times as you want.
    - **What You Can Do**: Make long programs shorter, reduce mistakes, and make it easier to fix code.

2. **File Operations (CSV/Excel)**

    - **Overview**: Techniques for saving data made by your program to a file or reading data from a file.
    - **What You Can Do**: Save attendance data to an Excel file or read it into your program.

3. **Basics of Classes**
    - **Overview**: A way to manage related information together, like "students" or "attendance records."
    - **What You Can Do**: Organize complex information and make your programs easier to understand.
