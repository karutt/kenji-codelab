## Variables and Data Types

In Python, you use "**variables**" to handle data. Here, let's learn about variables and the "**types (data types)**" of data they can hold.

### 1. What is a variable?

- **Overview**: Like a "box" for storing data, each with its own name.
- **What you can do**: Temporarily store numbers, text, `True`/`False`, etc., and use them as many times as you want in your program. You can name variables freely (with some rules).

```python
age = 20
name = "Taro"
is_student = True

print(age)        # Outputs 20
print(name)       # Outputs Taro
print(is_student) # Outputs True
```

### 2. What is a data type?

- **Overview**: Shows the "kind" of data a variable holds.
- **What you can do**: The type determines what you can do with the data.

Here are four main data types you'll often use in Python:

| Type      | Description          | Main Uses & Features                             | Example        |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| **int**   | Integer              | Used for arithmetic like addition/multiplication | `x = 10`       |
| **float** | Decimal number       | Used for calculations with decimals              | `pi = 3.14`    |
| **str**   | String (text)        | Handles text like sentences or names, in quotes  | `s = "hello"`  |
| **bool**  | Boolean (True/False) | Used for conditionals and logic                  | `flag = False` |

```python
x = 5           # int
y = 2.5         # float
s = "Python"    # str
flag = True     # bool
```

### 3. Checking the type

- Use the `type()` function to check a variable's data type.

```python
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
print(type(s))  # <class 'str'>
```
