## Preparing to Run Python

Before starting the lessons, let's get ready to run Python.

### 0. Create a "python" Folder (First Time Only)

Open your file explorer and create a folder named "python" in your root directory.  
You will save your Python program files (with the ".py" extension) in this folder.

1. **File**: Data stored on your PC, such as images, music, videos, or documents.
2. **Folder**: A box to organize files. For example, you might have a "Animal Photos" folder containing "dog.jpg," "cat.jpg," etc.
3. **Extension**: The ".xx" part that shows the file type. For example, ".jpg" for images, ".txt" for text files, and ".py" for Python program files.
