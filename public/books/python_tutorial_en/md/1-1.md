## Preparing to Run Python

Before starting the lesson, let's get ready to run Python.

### 0. Create a "python" folder (first time only)

Create a folder named "python" anywhere on your computer.  
You'll save your Python program files (with the ".py" extension) in this folder.

1. **File**: Data stored on your PC, such as images, music, videos, or documents.
2. **Folder**: Like a box for organizing files. For example, a "Pet Photos" folder might contain "dog.jpg" and "cat.jpg."
3. **Extension**: The ".xxx" part at the end of a file name that shows its type. For example, ".jpg" is an image file, ".txt" is a text file, and ".py" is a Python program file.
