## What is Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter Notebook is like a "digital notebook" where you can write code bit by bit, run it, and immediately check the results. Here are its main features:

- **Instant feedback**  
  You can run code in small blocks called "cells," so it's easy to see what happens where.

- **Write explanations and notes together**  
  You can write text and equations in Markdown format right next to your code. It's great for keeping learning records or making reports, just like writing comments in a notebook.

- **Easy graph and chart display**  
  You can show graphs and images right inside a cell, making it easier to understand your data as you go.

## Starting Jupyter Notebook in VSCode

### Creating a Notebook

1. Start VSCode and open your `python` project folder.

4. Open the file you just created and click **Select Kernel** at the top right.
    - Choose "Python Environments..." → "Python 3.11."

5. Now you can enter code into cells. First, press the shortcut key `A` to add a new cell.

6. Enter the following code in a cell and run it with `Shift + Enter`.
    ```python
     print("Hello!")
    ```

That's it—you've run your first code!
