## What is Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter Notebook is a tool that lets you write and run code in small steps, checking the results as you go. Here are its main features:

- **Instant Results**  
  You can run code in small blocks called "cells" and immediately see what happens.

- **Write Explanations and Notes**  
  You can write text and math in Markdown format next to your code. It's great for keeping learning records or making reports, just like writing comments in a notebook.

- **Easy Graphs and Charts**  
  You can display graphs and charts right in the cell, making it easy to understand your data.

## Getting Started with Jupyter Notebook in VSCode

### Creating a Notebook

1. Start VSCode and open your `python` folder.

6. Enter the following code in a cell and run it with `Shift + Enter`:
    ```python
    print("Hello!")
    ```

That's it! You've run your first code in a notebook.
