## Operators and Expressions

In programming, you use "operators" to perform calculations, comparisons, and make decisions. Here are the main types and how to use them.

### Arithmetic Operators (Calculations)

- **What You Can Do**: Perform addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and more.

```python
a = 5
b = 3

print(a + b)  # 8
print(a - b)  # 2
print(a * b)  # 15
print(a / b)  # 1.666...
```

### Comparison Operators (Comparing Values)

- **What You Can Do**: Compare two values and get `True` or `False` as a result. Used in "conditionals" you'll learn next.

| Operator | Meaning                      | Example  | Result  |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| `==`     | Equal to (`is` also works)   | `5 == 1` | `False` |
| `!=`     | Not equal to (`is not` also) | `5 != 3` | `True`  |
| `>`      | Greater than                 | `1 > 4`  | `False` |
| `<`      | Less than                    | `2 < 8`  | `True`  |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to     | `5 >= 5` | `True`  |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to        | `3 <= 5` | `True`  |

:::message
The result of a comparison operator is always a Boolean value: `True` or `False`.
:::

```python
x = 5
y = 5

print(x == y)  # True
print(x != y)  # False
print(x > 3)   # True
print(x < 10)  # True
```

### Logical Operators (Combining Conditions)

- **What You Can Do**: Use "and," "or," and "not" to combine or reverse conditions.

| Operator | Meaning        | Example          | Result  |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| `and`    | Both are True  | `True and False` | `False` |
| `or`     | Either is True | `True or False`  | `True`  |
| `not`    | Reverse        | `not False`      | `True`  |

```python
flag1 = True
flag2 = False

print(flag1 and flag2)  # False
print(flag1 or flag2)   # True
print(not flag2)        # True
```

```python
# Example combining with comparison operators
age = 12
is_student = False

print(age <= 18 or is_student)      # True
print(10 < age and age < 30)        # True
```

### Assignment Operators (Storing/Updating Values)

- **What You Can Do**: Assign values to variables or update them with calculations.

| Operator | Meaning             | Example  | Same as     |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `=`      | Assign value        | `x = 5`  | —           |
| `+=`     | Add and assign      | `x += 2` | `x = x + 2` |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign | `x -= 1` | `x = x - 1` |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign | `x *= 3` | `x = x * 3` |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign   | `x /= 2` | `x = x / 2` |

```python
x = 4         # Assign 4 to x
y = x + 5     # Assign x + 5 to y

x += 2        # Add 2 to x (x = x + 2)
print(x)      # 6
print(y)      # 9
```

```python
count = 0
```
