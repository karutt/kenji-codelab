## Operators and Expressions

In programming, you use "operators" to do calculations, comparisons, and make decisions. Here are the main types of operators and how to use them.

### Arithmetic Operators (Calculating Numbers)

- **What you can do**: Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and more for working with numbers.

```python
a = 5
b = 3

print(a + b)  # 8
print(a - b)  # 2
print(a * b)  # 15
print(a / b)  # 1.666...
```

### Comparison Operators (Comparing Values)

- **What you can do**: Compare two values and get `True` or `False` as a result. Used in "conditionals," which you'll learn on the next page.

| Operator | Meaning                      | Example  | Result  |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| `==`     | Equal to (can also use `is`) | `5 == 1` | `False` |
| `!=`     | Not equal (can use `is not`) | `5 != 3` | `True`  |
| `>`      | Greater than                 | `1 > 4`  | `False` |
| `<`      | Less than                    | `2 < 8`  | `True`  |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to     | `5 >= 5` | `True`  |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to        | `3 <= 5` | `True`  |

:::message
The result of an expression using a comparison operator is always a Boolean value: `True` or `False`.
:::

```python
x = 5
y = 5

print(x == y)  # True
print(x != y)  # False
print(x > 3)   # True
print(x < 10)  # True
```

### Logical Operators (Combining Conditions)

- **What you can do**: Use "and," "or," and "not" to combine multiple conditions or reverse their meaning.

| Operator | Meaning        | Example          | Result  |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| `and`    | Both are True  | `True and False` | `False` |
| `or`     | Either is True | `True or False`  | `True`  |
| `not`    | Negate         | `not False`      | `True`  |

```python
flag1 = True
flag2 = False

print(flag1 and flag2)  # False
print(flag1 or flag2)   # True
print(not flag2)        # True
```

```python
# Example combining comparison and logical operators
age = 12
is_student = False

print(age <= 18 or is_student)      # True
print(10 < age and age < 30)        # True
```

### Assignment Operators (Storing and Updating Values)

- **What you can do**: Assign values to variables or update them with calculations.

| Operator | Meaning           | Example  | Equivalent to |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `=`      | Assign value      | `x = 5`  | —             |
| `+=`     | Add and assign    | `x += 2` | `x = x + 2`   |
| `-=`     | Subtract & assign | `x -= 1` | `x = x - 1`   |
| `*=`     | Multiply & assign | `x *= 3` | `x = x * 3`   |
| `/=`     | Divide & assign   | `x /= 2` | `x = x / 2`   |

```python
x = 4         # Assign 4 to x
y = x + 5     # Assign x + 5 to y

x += 2        # Add 2 to x (x = x + 2)
print(x)      # 6
print(y)      # 9
```

```python
count = 0

count += 3
print(count)  # 3

count *= 5
print(count)  # 15

count -= 7
print(count)  # 8

count /= 2
print(count)  # 4.0
```
