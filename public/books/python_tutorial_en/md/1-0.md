## 1. What is a Programming Language?

A computer doesn't think or make decisions on its own. To tell it "I want you to do this!", we need to write instructions in a language the computer understands. That's where "programming languages" come in.

- **The Role of Programming Languages**

    - A programming language is a "tool" for accurately telling the computer what you want it to do.
    - Just like a cooking recipe clearly lists "ingredients" and "steps," a programming language lets you write out "what data to use and how to process it" in order.
    - When you write instructions this way, the computer can read them and do exactly what you want.

## 2. What is Python?

Python is a programming language that lets you give instructions to a computer using words that are close to natural English (or Japanese).

For example, if you want to display text on the screen, you only need a single line:

```python
print("Hello!")
```

Other languages often require lots of symbols or difficult keywords, but Python is known for letting you write what you want to do in a very intuitive way.

## 3. Why is Python recommended for beginners?

1. **Readable code**

    - You can show code blocks just by indenting (adding spaces at the start of a line).
    - It looks clean and natural, almost like an English sentence!

2. **Easy to run**

    - You can run the file you wrote right away, without any special setup.
    - It's easy to "write a little, try it out, and repeat."

3. **Lots of helpful tools**
    - There are many handy components called "libraries" (for image processing, games, AI, etc.).
    - If you want to use one, just run `pip install {library_name}` to add it.

## 4. What can you do with Python?

1. **Build websites**

    - You can make shopping sites or blogs using frameworks like "Django" or "Flask."

2. **Data analysis & AI**

    - Use "NumPy" or "Pandas" to aggregate and analyze data, or try out machine learning (AI) models with "TensorFlow" or "scikit-learn."

3. **Automation**

    - Automate tedious tasks like organizing files, processing data, or sending routine emails.

4. **Game development**

    - You can even make simple games using tools like "Pygame."

## 5. How do you get started with Python?

1. **Install Python (already prepared)**

    - Download it from the official site (python.org). Works on Windows and Mac.

2. **Get an editor (already prepared)**

    - Prepare an editor like VSCode, which makes it easy to write and run code.
    - With an editor, you can write and run code easily.

3. **Write your first program**
    - On the next page, "**Getting Ready to Write Code**," let's try writing your first program!
