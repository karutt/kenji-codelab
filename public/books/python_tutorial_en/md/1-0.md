## What is a Programming Language?

A computer cannot think or make decisions on its own. We need to write instructions in a language the computer understands to tell it what we want it to do. This is where "programming languages" come in.

- **Role of Programming Languages**
    - Programming languages are tools to accurately tell the computer what you want it to do.
    - Just like a recipe explains how to cook a dish step by step, programming languages describe "what data to use and how to process it" in order.
    - The computer reads these instructions and acts as we intend.

## What is Python?

Python is a programming language that allows you to give instructions to a computer using grammar that is close to natural human language.

For example, to display text on the screen, you just write one line:

```python
print("Hello!")
```

Other languages often require many symbols or difficult keywords, but Python is intuitive and feels like talking to the computer.

## Why is Python Recommended for Beginners?

1. **Readable Syntax**

    - You can express code blocks just by indenting.
    - It looks clean and natural, almost like English.

2. **Quick to Run**

    - You can run the file as-is without special setup.
    - It's easy to "write a little and try it right away."

3. **Lots of Helpful Libraries**
    - There are many useful components called "libraries" (for image processing, games, AI, etc.).
    - You can add them easily with `pip install {library_name}`.

## What Can You Do with Python?

1. **Create Websites**

    - You can make shopping sites or blogs using frameworks like "Django" or "Flask."

2. **Data Analysis & AI**

    - You can analyze and summarize data with "NumPy" or "Pandas," and try machine learning (AI) with "TensorFlow" or "scikit-learn."

3. **Automation**
    - You can automate tedious tasks like file organization, data processing, or sending routine emails.

## How to Start with Python

1. **Install Python**

    - Download Python from the official website (python.org). It works on Windows and Mac.

2. **Prepare an Editor**

    - Get a code editor like VSCode. This makes writing and running code much easier.

3. **Write Your First Program**
    - Refer to the next page, "**Preparing to Write Code**," and try writing your first program!
