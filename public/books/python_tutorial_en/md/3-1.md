## What is a Function?

When writing programs, you often have to write the same kind of process many times. For example, if you want to display "Hello, ○○!" many times, it's a pain to write the same code over and over.

That's where "**functions**" come in handy!

### What is a Function?

- **Overview**: A way to give a name to a process you use often, so you can reuse it as much as you want
- **What You Can Do**:
    - Write the same process in a shorter way
    - Make fewer mistakes
    - Make your program easier to read

A function is like a "recipe." Once you make it, you can use it to make the same dish (process) any time.

## Basic Way to Write a Function

### 1. Define a Function

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
    print("Let's do our best today!")
```

- `def`: Means "I'm about to make a function"
- `greet()`: The function's name (you can choose any name)
- `:`: Shows where the function's contents start
- Indent: Always indent the contents of a function

### 2. Use (Call) a Function

```python
# Call the function
greet()
```

Try it out:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
    print("Let's do our best today!")

# Use the function
greet()
greet()
greet()
```

Result:

```
Hello!
Let's do our best today!
Hello!
Let's do our best today!
Hello!
Let's do our best today!
```

---

## Using Arguments

You can make functions more useful by passing data to them. This is called an "**argument**."

### Greeting Function with a Name

```python
def greet_person(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    print("Let's do our best today!")

# Try it out
greet_person("Taro")
greet_person("Hanako")
greet_person("Sensei")
```

Result:

```
Hello, Taro!
Let's do our best today!
Hello, Hanako!
Let's do our best today!
Hello, Sensei!
Let's do our best today!
```

### Using Multiple Arguments

```python
def introduce(name, age, hobby):
    print(f"My name is {name}.")
    print(f"I am {age} years old.")
    print(f"My favorite thing is {hobby}.")

# Try it out
introduce("Taro", 14, "soccer")
introduce("Hanako", 13, "reading")
```

Result:

```
My name is Taro.
I am 14 years old.
My favorite thing is soccer.
My name is Hanako.
I am 13 years old.
My favorite thing is reading.
```

## Using Return Values

A function can return the result of a calculation. This is called a "**return value**."

### Function to Calculate an Average

```python
def calculate_average(score1, score2, score3):
    total = score1 + score2 + score3
    average = total / 3
    return average  # Return the average

# Try it out
result1 = calculate_average(80, 90, 70)
result2 = calculate_average(100, 85, 95)

print(f"Average of 80, 90, 70: {result1}")
print(f"Average of 100, 85, 95: {result2}")
```

Result:

```
Average of 80, 90, 70: 80.0
Average of 100, 85, 95: 93.33333333333333
```

### Function to Judge Attendance Status

Let's make a function that automatically judges attendance status based on the time:

```python
import datetime

def check_attendance(hour, minute):
    # Convert time to minutes for easy comparison
    time_in_minutes = hour * 60 + minute

    # 8:00 is 480 minutes, 10:00 is 600 minutes
    if time_in_minutes < 480:  # Before 8:00
        return "Present"
    elif time_in_minutes <= 600:  # 8:00–10:00
        return "Late"
    else:  # After 10:00
        return "Absent"

# Try it out
result1 = check_attendance(7, 45)  # 7:45
result2 = check_attendance(8, 30)  # 8:30
result3 = check_attendance(10, 15) # 10:15

print(f"7:45: {result1}")
print(f"8:30: {result2}")
print(f"10:15: {result3}")
```

Result:

```
7:45: Present
8:30: Late
10:15: Absent
```

### More Practical Attendance Function

You can also make a function that automatically gets the current time and judges attendance:

```python
import datetime

def check_current_attendance():
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    hour = now.hour
    minute = now.minute

    time_in_minutes = hour * 60 + minute

    if time_in_minutes < 480:  # Before 8:00
        status = "Present"
    elif time_in_minutes <= 600:  # 8:00–10:00
        status = "Late"
    else:  # After 10:00
        status = "Absent"

    return f"{hour}:{minute} - {status}"

# Try it out (the result will change depending on the actual time)
current_status = check_current_attendance()
print(f"Current attendance status: {current_status}")
```
