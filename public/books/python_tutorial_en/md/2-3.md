By now, you should have a basic understanding of how to use Python. But to make more practical programs, you'll need to think a bit more deeply. For example, you might want to change what your program does based on certain conditions, or repeat the same action multiple times.

From here, let's learn about "**control structures**" that make these kinds of behaviors possible.

## How do you get input from the user?

To make your programs more practical, you'll want to change their behavior based on "values entered by the user."  
For that, you use the `input()` function.

```python
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name, "!")
```

- `input()` is a function that gets input from the keyboard.
- The value entered is always stored as a **string (str type)** in a variable.

This way, you can add "human decisions" or "user input" to your programs.

Next, let's learn how to change what your program does based on the "input value"—in other words, "**conditional branching**."

## What are control structures?

So far, your code has followed the rule of "**executing from top to bottom**" unless you specify otherwise. This is called "**sequential execution**."

But that's not enough to express real-world logic. For example, to turn the following flowchart into code, you need a way to control the flow yourself.

To "branch the process based on conditions," you use "**conditional statements**."

## Conditional Branching (if / elif / else)

- **Overview**: A structure that checks if a condition is `True` or `False` and switches what happens accordingly.
- **What you can do**: Create flows like "If ~, do this; otherwise, do that."

### Basic form of if statements

```python
if condition:      # If the condition is True
    action1        # This action is executed
else:              # If the condition is False
    action2        # This action is executed instead
```

### Practice: Change the message based on input

Here's a program that asks the user for their age and shows a different message depending on the answer.

```python
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are 18 or older.")
else:
    print("You are under 18.")
```

With if statements, you can make your program "respond to input."  
Once you understand this, you'll be able to write more flexible programs when you learn about "loops" next time.

:::message

- The `input()` function lets you get text input from the keyboard.
- The `int()` function converts the entered string (like `"18"`) into a number (integer).  
   Since `input()` always returns a string, you need to convert it if you want to compare numbers.
  :::

## elif (handling more than two conditions)

What if you want to split things up even more, like "under 13," "13 to under 18," etc.?  
That's where `elif` (short for "else if") comes in.

```python
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

if age < 13:
    print("You are under 13.")
elif age < 18:
    print("You are 13 or older, but under 18.")
else:
    print("You are 18 or older.")
```

- If the first `if` condition is `False`, it checks the next `elif`.
- If none match, the final `else` is executed.

This way, you can write **three or more branches** cleanly.

## Practice: Let's make an automatic message program

Finally, let's combine `input()` and `if / elif / else` to make a simple automatic message program.

```python
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

if age < 6:
    print(name, "is a preschooler!")
elif age < 12:
    print(name, "is an elementary school student!")
elif age < 15:
    print(name, "is a junior high school student!")
elif age < 18:
    print(name, "is a high school student!")
else:
    print(name, "is 18 or older!")
```

By displaying **messages that match the input**, your programs become much more practical.

In the next chapter, you'll learn about "**loops**" for repeating actions.  
Combining conditionals and loops lets you write even more flexible and complex programs.
