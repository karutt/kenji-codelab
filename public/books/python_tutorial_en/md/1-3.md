Jupyter Notebook offers a variety of shortcut keys to make running code and working with cells smoother.

## Edit Mode vs. Command Mode

Jupyter Notebook has two modes. Knowing which mode you're in helps you use shortcuts correctly.

- **Command Mode**
    - Lets you add, delete, or move cells—operations that affect whole cells.
    - Press `Esc` to switch from Edit Mode to Command Mode.
    - The cursor inside the cell disappears, and the whole cell is selected.

- **Edit Mode**

    - Lets you type and edit text inside a cell.
    - Click inside a cell or press `Enter` after selecting a cell to enter Edit Mode.
    - The cursor appears inside the cell, ready for input.

## Main Shortcuts (Both Modes)

| Shortcut           | Action                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl + Enter`     | Run the cell and stay in the cell |
| `Shift + Enter`    | Run the cell and move to the next |
| `Ctrl + Z`         | Undo the last action              |
| `Ctrl + Shift + Z` | Redo the last undone action       |

## Main Shortcuts (Command Mode)

These are handy when you're in Command Mode.

| `B`       | Add a new cell below          |
| `X`       | Delete the selected cell      |
| `Z`       | Restore the last deleted cell |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move cell up/down             |

## Main Shortcuts (Edit Mode)

Useful keys when you're editing inside a cell.

| Shortcut   | Action                           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl + [` | Decrease indent                  |
| `Ctrl + ]` | Increase indent                  |
| `Ctrl + /` | Comment/uncomment selected lines |
| `Ctrl + A` | Select all in the cell           |
| `Ctrl + C` | Copy selected text               |
| `Ctrl + V` | Paste copied text                |

## Tips for Switching Modes
