## What Are Data Structures?

So far, you've learned about basic data types like `int`, `str`, and `bool`. These are for storing a single value.

But in real programs, you often want to handle "all students' names" or "a list of test scores"—in other words, **many pieces of data together**.

That's where "**data structures**" come in.

- **Data Structure**: A way to efficiently store and manage multiple pieces of data
- **Types**: Arrays (lists), dictionaries, sets, and more
- **Purpose**: To organize, search, add, and remove data efficiently

In this chapter, you'll learn about the most basic and important data structure: the **array (list)**.

## What Is an Array (List)?

An **array (list)** is a "box" that can store multiple values in order.

- **Features**:
    - Manage many pieces of the same kind of data together
    - Has an order (first, second, ...)
    - You can add, remove, or change values later

In Python, it's called a "list," but in other languages, it's often called an "array."

### How to Make an Array (List)

```python
# List of strings
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]

# List of numbers
scores = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]

# Empty list (add data later)
students = []
```

- Use `[]` (square brackets) and separate values with commas
- Usually, you group the same kind of data, but you can mix types
- You can also make an empty list

### Basic List Operations

#### Accessing Elements (Index)

```python
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]

print(fruits[0])  # apple (first)
print(fruits[1])  # orange (second)
print(fruits[2])  # banana (third)
```

- List numbering (index) **starts at 0**
- Use `list_name[number]` to get the value at that position

#### Adding and Removing Elements

```python
fruits = ["apple", "orange"]

# Add to the end
fruits.append("banana")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']

# Insert at a specific position
fruits.insert(1, "strawberry")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'strawberry', 'orange', 'banana']

# Remove an element
fruits.remove("orange")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'strawberry', 'banana']
```

#### Checking List Information

```python
scores = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]

print(len(scores))    # 5 (number of elements)
print(max(scores))    # 96 (max value)
print(min(scores))    # 78 (min value)
print(sum(scores))    # 439 (total)
```

## Why Use Arrays?

Why do we need arrays? Let's look at an example.

### Bad Example: Making Lots of Variables

```python
student1 = "Taro"
student2 = "Hanako"
student3 = "Jiro"
student4 = "Misaki"

print(student1)
print(student2)
print(student3)
print(student4)
```

Problems with this method:

- You need a new variable for every student
- It's hard to process them all together
- The program gets long

### Good Example: Using an Array

```python
students = ["Taro", "Hanako", "Jiro", "Misaki"]

print(students[0])  # Taro
print(students[1])  # Hanako
print(students[2])  # Jiro
print(students[3])  # Misaki
```

With this method:

- You manage lots of data with one variable
- It's easy to add more students
- The program is cleaner

## Basic List Operations

### Creating a List

```python
# List of strings
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]

# List of numbers
scores = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]

# Empty list (add data later)
shopping_list = []
```

### Accessing Elements (Index)

```python
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]

print(fruits[0])  # apple (first)
print(fruits[1])  # orange (second)
print(fruits[2])  # banana (third)
```

**Important**: List numbering (index) **starts at 0**

### Adding and Changing Elements

```python
fruits = ["apple", "orange"]

# Add to the end
fruits.append("banana")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']

# Change an element
fruits[1] = "strawberry"
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'strawberry', 'banana']
```

### Checking List Information

```python
scores = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]

print(len(scores))    # 5 (number of elements)
print(max(scores))    # 96 (max value)
print(min(scores))    # 78 (min value)
```

## Summary

In this chapter, you learned the basics of **data structures** and the most important one: **arrays (lists)**.

### Key Points

1. **Data Structure**: A way to efficiently manage multiple pieces of data
2. **Creating a List**: `[item1, item2, item3]`
3. **Getting Elements**: `list_name[index]` (starts at 0)
4. **Adding Elements**: `list_name.append(value)`

### Benefits of Lists

- Manage related data together
- Cleaner, easier-to-read programs
- Easy to add or change data

In the next chapter, you'll learn about **loops (for statements)** using lists.  
Combining lists and for loops lets you write even more powerful and practical programs.
