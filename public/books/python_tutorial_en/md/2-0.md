## Overview of Python Basics

Let's check what you'll learn as the basics of Python.

1. **Variables and Data Types**

    - **Overview**: Variables are like "boxes" for storing values. Data types describe what kind of values (numbers, text, etc.) go in those boxes.
    - **What you can do**: Store numbers or text and use them as many times as you want.

2. **Operators and Expressions**

    - **Overview**: Symbols like "+" or "==" are used for calculations and comparisons. You combine them to make "expressions."
    - **What you can do**: Not just add or subtract, but also compare values and express "true/false" logic in your program.

3. **Control Structures**
    - **Overview**: Commands that control the order in which your program runs, as well as branching and repeating.
    - **What you can do**: Switch actions based on conditions (`if`), or repeat actions (`for` / `while`).

By mastering these basics, you'll build a solid foundation for programming in Python.  
From the next chapter, you'll learn each topic in detail and deepen your understanding by actually writing code.
