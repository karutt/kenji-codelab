## Overview of Python Basics

Let's check what you'll learn as basic Python operations.

1. **Variables and Data Types**

    - **Overview**: Variables are like "boxes" for storing values. Data types indicate what kind of values go in the box (numbers, text, etc.).
    - **What You Can Do**: Store numbers or text and use them as many times as you want later.

2. **Operators and Expressions**

    - **Overview**: Symbols like "+" or "==" are used for calculations and comparisons. You combine these to make "expressions."
    - **What You Can Do**: Not just addition and subtraction, but also compare values and express "true/false" logic in your program.

3. **Control Structures**
    - **Overview**: Commands that control the order of execution, branching, and repetition in your program.
    - **What You Can Do**: Switch processing based on conditions (`if`), or repeat actions (`for` / `while`).
