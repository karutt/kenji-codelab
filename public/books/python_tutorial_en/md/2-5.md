## Loops (for Statements)

In the previous chapter, you learned how to use "if" statements to change what happens based on conditions.  
Now, let's learn about **loops**, which let you **repeat the same process multiple times**.

In Python, the most common loops are `for` and `while`. Here, we'll start with `for` loops.

## What is a for Loop?

A `for` loop is a structure for **taking items from a list or range one by one and repeating the same process**.

For example, imagine searching for a student named "Taro" in a table like this:

| i   | Name    | Status  |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| 0   | Jiro    | Late    |
| 1   | Zenjiro | Present |
| 2   | Taro    | Early   |
| 3   | Santaro | Present |

The orange flow in the diagram keeps looping with `i += 1` as long as the condition is `No`, searching for the next student. This is what a `for` loop does.

## Basic for Loop Structure

A `for` loop takes "a group of values" and repeats the same process for each one.

```python
for variable in group_of_data:
    # Process to repeat
```

### Example: Displaying List Elements in Order

```python
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

- The contents of the `fruits` list are taken one by one into the variable `fruit` and displayed with `print()`.
- The result is:

```
apple
orange
banana
```

## Using range() to Repeat a Set Number of Times

If you want to repeat something a **fixed number of times**, use the `range()` function.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

- `range(5)` gives you the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- `i` changes from 0 to 4.

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

### Specifying Start and Step

You can write `range(start, stop, step)` to specify the range in detail.

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

→ Displays 1 to 5 (the stop value is not included).

## Practice: Calculate the Sum from 1 to 10

Let's use a for loop to calculate the sum from 1 to 10.

```python
total = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    total += i
print("The sum is", total)
```

- `total += i` means `total = total + i`.
- It adds up the numbers from 1 to 10 in order.

## Nested for Loops
