# (1) Basic for Loop

Print the numbers from 1 to 5 in order.

##

```python
for i in range(?, ?):
    print(i)
```

# (2) Print All Elements of a List

Print each element of the list `fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "grape"]` one by one.

##

```python
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "grape"]
for fruit in ?:
    print(fruit)
```

# (3) Combine for and if Statements

Print only the even numbers from 1 to 10.

##

```python
for i in range(1, ?):
    if i ? 2 == 0:
        print(i)
```

# (4) Count Number of Characters

Print only the words with 4 or more characters from the list `words = ["cat", "elephant", "dog", "butterfly"]`.

##

```python
words = ["cat", "elephant", "dog", "butterfly"]
for word in words:
    if ?(word) >= ?:
        print(word)
```

# (5) Pass/Fail Judgment for Scores

For the list `scores = [85, 67, 92, 45, 78, 90]`, print "Pass" for scores 80 or above, and "Fail" for scores below 80.

##

```python
scores = [85, 67, 92, 45, 78, 90]
for score in scores:
    if score >= ?:
        print(f"{score} points: ?")
    else:
        print(f"{score} points: ?")
```

# (6) Print Only Positive Numbers

Print only the positive numbers (greater than 0) from the list `numbers = [5, -3, 8, -1, 0, 12, -7]`.

##

```python
numbers = [5, -3, 8, -1, 0, 12, -7]
for number in numbers:
    if number ? 0:
        print(number)
```

# (7) Nested for Loops

Create a multiplication table from 1×1 to 9×9 and print the results.

##

```python
for i in range(1, ?):
    for j in range(1, ?):
        result = i ? j
        print(f"{i} × {j} = {result}")
```

# (8) Practice: Count Favorite Fruits

Count how many times "apple" appears in the list `fruits = ["apple", "orange", "apple", "banana", "apple", "orange"]`.

##

```python
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "apple", "banana", "apple", "orange"]
apple_count = 0

for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == ?:
        apple_count ? 1

print(f"Number of apples: {apple_count}")
```
