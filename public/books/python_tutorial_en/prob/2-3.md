# (1) Age Check

Complete the code according to the instructions below.

1. Assign the user's age (as an integer) to a variable called `age`.
2. If the age is 18 or older, print "Adult". Otherwise, print "Minor".

##

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if ?:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")
```

# (2) Password Authentication

Suppose the correct password is `"python123"`. Get input from the user, and if it matches, display "Login successful". If not, display "Incorrect password".

##

```python
password = input("Enter your password: ")
if ?:
    print("Login successful")
else:
    print("Incorrect password")
```

# (3) Test Pass/Fail Judgment

If the score is 60 or higher, it's a pass; otherwise, it's a fail. Write a program to determine this.

1. Assign the test score (as an integer) to `score`.
2. Display "Pass" or "Fail" according to the condition.

##

```python
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))
if ?:
    print("Pass")
else:
    print("Fail")
```

# (4) Classify into Three Categories

Write a program that outputs a message according to the temperature.

- Below 15째C: `"It's cold"`
- 15째C or more but less than 25째C: `"It's just right"`
- 25째C or more: `"It's hot"`

##

```python
temperature = int(input("Enter the temperature: "))

if ?:
    print("It's cold")
elif ?:
    print("It's just right")
else:
    print("It's hot")
```

# (5) Even or Odd

To calculate the remainder of a number, use the `%` operator. For example,

- `5 % 2` is `1` (because the remainder when dividing 5 by 2 is 1).
- `6 % 2` is `0` (because the remainder when dividing 6 by 2 is 0).

Using the `%` operator, write a program to determine whether the number entered by the user is even or odd.

Hint: Even numbers have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2.

##

```python
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if ?:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")
```
