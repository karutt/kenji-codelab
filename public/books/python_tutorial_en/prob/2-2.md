# (1) Output the Sum of Two Numbers

Assign `10` to variable `a` and `20` to variable `b`, then output the sum of `a` and `b`.

```python:template
a = ?
b = ?
print(?)
```

# (2) Calculate Changes in Money

Assign `500` to `n`, then perform the following operations in order and output the final amount:

- Spend half of the money
- Receive 200 yen
- Spend 50 yen

```python:template
n = 500
n ?= ?  # Spend half of the money
n ?= ?  # Receive 200 yen
n ?= ?  # Spend 50 yen
print(n)
```

# (3) Calculate 2 to the Power of 8

Calculate and output 2 to the power of 8 (2 multiplied by itself 8 times). Use the `**` operator for exponentiation.

```python:template
print(?)
```

# (4) Which is Bigger?

Compare `5` to the power of `3` and `4` to the power of `2`, and output the result (`True`/`False`).

```python:template
print(? > ?)
```

# (5) "OK" if 18 or Older and a Student

Assign `18` to variable `age` and `True` to `is_student`.
Use logical operators so that only if `age` is 18 or older and `is_student` is `True`, "OK" is output with `print()`.

```python:template
age = ?
is_student = ?
print(? and ?)
```
