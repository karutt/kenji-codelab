# (1) Output the sum of a and b

Complete the code according to the instructions below.

1. Assign 100 to the variable `a`.
2. Assign 200 to the variable `b`.
3. Output the sum of `a` and `b`.

##

```
a = ?
b = ?
print(?)
```

# (2) Exponentiation

You can calculate powers using the `**` operator. For example, `2**3` calculates 2 to the power of 3 (2×2×2). Use this to calculate how thick a sheet of paper (1mm thick) becomes after folding it 10 times.

:::details Hint

- After folding once, the thickness doubles: `2 = 2mm`.
- After folding twice, the thickness quadruples: `2×2 = 4mm`.
- After folding three times, the thickness is 8 times: `2×2×2 = 8mm`.
- So, how thick will it be after folding 10 times?

# (3) Mitsuru's Shopping

Mitsuru starts with 1000 yen. Assign this to the variable `n`. Then, the following three events happen in order:

1. He goes shopping and his money is halved.
2. He gets an allowance and his money increases by 200 yen.
3. He spends 200 yen shopping.

How much money does Mitsuru have left? Use assignment operators to calculate.

##

```python
n = 1000
? # Money is halved
? # Allowance: increase by 200 yen
? # Spent 200 yen shopping
print(n)
```

# (4) Comparing Large Numbers

Which is larger: 2 to the 100th power or 3 to the 70th power? Use comparison operators to calculate and answer which is bigger.

##

```python

```

# (5) Two Conditions

Takahashi is a 30-year-old who is married. He decided to call anyone who is "20 or older" and "married" an "adult." Is Takahashi an "adult"?  
Write a condition using the variables `age` and `is_married` to check if he is an adult, and output the result.

##

```python
age = 30
is_married = True
print(?)

```
