# Problem 1: Electronic Dice

Follow these steps to create an electronic dice with faces numbered from 1 to 6.

- Use the `random` function to create the electronic dice.
- However, the `random` function returns floating-point numbers, so you need to convert them to integers.

| Function Name | Description                            | Example           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `floor(n)`    | Rounds `n` down to the nearest integer | `floor(3.9) => 3` |
| `ceil(n)`     | Rounds `n` up to the nearest integer   | `ceil(3.1) => 4`  |
| `round(n)`    | Rounds `n` to the nearest integer      | `round(3.5) => 4` |

- The table above shows functions in p5.js that convert floating-point numbers to integers. Use the appropriate function and the `random` function to create an electronic dice with faces numbered from 1 to 6.

# Problem 2: Twinkling Starry Sky

Follow these steps to create code that draws a starry sky.

- Create a `400`x`400` canvas.
- Set the background color to `#2B2D42` and the star color to `#FFD523`.
- Draw stars as circles of random sizes (1 to 8) at random positions on the canvas. Gradually increase the number of stars by drawing them inside the `draw` function.

::: details Hint

- Use the `background` function to set the background color, but if you use it inside the `draw` function, the background will be drawn every frame, erasing the stars drawn so far. Set the background color only once.
- To draw circles at random positions on the canvas, set the x and y coordinates of the circles to random values. Think about the range of random values for the x and y coordinates.

# Problem 3: Snake Walk

Follow these steps to create code that draws a line connecting the center of the canvas to the mouse position.

- Create a `400`x`400` canvas.
- Define the mouse x coordinate as variable `x1` and the y coordinate as variable `y1`.
- Define the canvas center x coordinate as variable `x2` and the y coordinate as variable `y2`.
- Use `x1` and `y1` to draw a circle with a diameter of `20` at the mouse position.
- Use `x2` and `y2` to draw a circle with a diameter of `20` at the center of the canvas.
- Connect `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` with the `line` function.

::: details Hint

- Since the mouse position is constantly updated, write the code inside the `draw` function.
- Use the `mouseX` and `mouseY` variables to get the mouse position.
- Use the `width` and `height` variables to get the center position of the canvas.
