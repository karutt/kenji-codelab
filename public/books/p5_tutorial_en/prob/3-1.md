# Dice Size

Create a variable called `dice1` and set its value randomly. The range of random values should be from 1 to 6. If the value is greater than 3, output `3 or more`, otherwise output `less than 3`.

```js
function setup() {
    // ここに処理を記述

# Sunset

Write code to draw a sunset.

First, create a `400x400` canvas with a background color of `#E4EDF4`. Represent the horizon by drawing a rectangle (`rect`) in the lower half with the color `#948079`. Draw the sun as a circle (`circle`) at the position of the mouse cursor. The color of the circle should be `#FFD700`. However, if the sun is in the lower half of the canvas, the color of the circle should be `#FF4500`.
