# if Statement

Write an if statement that always evaluates to `true`. When the condition is true, output the string `"The condition is true"`.

##

```js
function setup() {
    // Write your code here
}
```

# if - else Statement

Write an if - else statement that always evaluates to `false`. When the condition is `true`, output the string `"The condition is true"`, and when the condition is `false`, output the string `"The condition is false"`.

##

```js
function setup() {
    // ここに処理を記述
}
```

# Dice Size

A variable called `dice` is assigned a random value between 1 and 6. If the value is greater than 3, output `3 or more`, otherwise output `less than 3`.

##

```js
function setup() {
    let dice = random(1, 6);
    if () {
        print()
    } else {
        print()
    }
}
```

# Shopping

You and your friend went to a famous sweets shop and ordered two cakes (580 yen each) and two iced teas (420 yen each). Assuming a consumption tax of 10%, assign the total amount to a variable called `sum`. Then, if the value of `sum` is 2000 yen or more, output `Very angry (ꐦ•ω•)`, otherwise output `Happy rabbit (⁎⁍̴̆Ɛ⁍̴̆⁎)`.

##

```js
function setup() {
    let cake = 480;
    let tea = 280;
    let tax = 1.1;
    let sum = ;
    if () {
        print()
    } else {
        print()
    }
}
```

# Difficult Person

There is a difficult person. They are kind to children and the elderly, but very strict with young adults. Specifically, depending on the age of the person they meet:

-   If the age is between 0 and 17, output `(* >ω<)`
-   If the age is between 18 and 64, output `(╯°□°）╯`
-   Otherwise, output `(*´∀｀)b`

Assuming your age is 15, output the expression this person would make.

##

```js
function setup() {
    let age = 15;
    if () {
        print()
    } else if () {
        print()
    } else {
        print()
    }
}
```

# Fan Activity

You are a fan and decided to give birthday presents to the members of your favorite group. There are 3 members, and their birthdays are as follows:

-   Yuki Shirakusa (June 30)
-   Shuri Amane (August 28)
-   Mitsuki Kazama (November 30)

Create a program to check if today is someone's birthday. Assuming today is June 30, if it is someone's birthday, output `Fan's name + 🎁`. Use variables `month` and `day` to manage the month and day respectively.

##

```js
function setup() {
    let month = 6;
    let day = 30;
    if () {
        print("")
    } else if () {
        print("")
    } else if () {
        print("")
    }
}
```

# Day and Night

There is a world where the right half is day and the left half is night. Draw the sun (a circle with a diameter of 50) at the position of the mouse cursor, and change the color of the sun depending on its position.

##

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
    let nightColor = "#191970";
    let dayColor = "#87CEEB";
    let sunColor = "#FFD700";
    let moonColor = "#D3D3D3";

    // Day background
    fill();
    rect();
    // Night background
    fill();
    rect();

    if () {
        fill();
    } else {
        fill();
    }
    circle();
}
```

# Mysterious Box

There is a 200×200 box. When the mouse cursor is inside the box, the color of the box changes to green. Determine if the mouse cursor is inside the box and change the color of the box accordingly.

##

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    testAlign(CENTER, CENTER);
}

function draw() {
    let x = mouseX;
    let y = mouseY;

    // Draw background
    background("#E4EDF4");

    // Condition for displaying text
    let xIsInBox = ;
    let yIsInBox = ;

    if (xIsInBox && yIsInBox) {
        fill("#A4F4A4");
    } else {
        fill("#F4A4AD");
    }
    rect(100, 100, 200, 200);
}

```

# Planet Exploration

There are 3 "planets" displayed on the screen. Each planet is drawn as a circle and has a different position. When the mouse cursor enters the range of a specific planet, the display changes based on the following conditions:

1. Blue planet
    - When the mouse is within a radius of `60`px, the color changes to "yellow".
    - However, if the mouse is to the right of the center of this planet, the color changes to "red".
2. Green planet
    - When the mouse is within a radius of `80`px, the planet "expands (radius `120`px)".
    - Furthermore, if both `mouseX` and `mouseY` are less than the center of the planet, the color changes to "purple".
3. Red planet
    - When the mouse is within a radius of `50`px, the entire background becomes "dark (gray)" and the planet changes to "white".

Use the `dist` function to calculate the distance between the mouse cursor and the planet. For example, the distance between `point A (mouseX, mouseY)` and `point B (x, y)` can be calculated as follows:

```js
let distance = dist(mouseX, mouseY, x, y);
```

##

```js
// Information about the blue planet
let blueX = 100;
let blueY = 200;
let blueR = 60;
let blueColor = "#007AFF";

// Information about the green planet
let greenX = 250;
let greenY = 150;
let greenR = 80;
let greenColor = "#9ACE62";

// Information about the gray planet
let grayX = 300;
let grayY = 300;
let grayR = 50;
let grayColor = "#FF3B30";

function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    noStroke();
}

function draw() {
    background("#E4EDF4");

    fill(blueColor);
    ellipse(blueX, blueY, blueR * 2, blueR * 2);

    fill(greenColor);
    ellipse(greenX, greenY, greenR * 2, greenR * 2);

    fill(grayColor);
    ellipse(grayX, grayY, grayR * 2, grayR * 2);
}
```
