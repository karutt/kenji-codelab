# Problem 1: Declaring a Variable

Declare a variable named `radius` and assign it the value `120`.

# Problem 2: Updating a Variable

Declare a variable named `value` and assign it the value `10`. Then, perform the following calculations to update the value of `value`.

- Add `5` to `value`
- Multiply `value` by `3`
- Subtract `2` from `value`
- Divide `value` by `2`

Finally, output the value of `value`.

# Problem 3: Circle in the Center of the Canvas

Write code to create a `400` x `400` canvas and draw a circle with a diameter of `100` in the center of the canvas. However, manage the center coordinates of the circle with variables `x` and `y` to accommodate any canvas size.

:::details Hint
You can calculate the center coordinates of the canvas using the built-in variables `width` and `height`.

# Problem 4: Day and Night

Write code to create a `400` x `400` canvas and fill half of the screen with a rectangle of color code `#F1F5F9` and the other half with a rectangle of color code `#2B2D42`. Use built-in variables to ensure that the screen is always half-filled, even if the canvas size changes.

:::details Hint
Think about the x and y coordinates, width, and height of the two rectangles as shown in the image below.
