# Problem 1

Create a canvas with dimensions `400` x `400`.

# Problem 2

Write code to draw a circle with a diameter of `100` at the center of the canvas. The circle should be filled with a red color and should not have an outline.

# Problem 3

What color will the circle be when the following code is executed? Explain your reasoning.

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background('#F1F5F9');

    fill(255, 0, 0);
    circle(200, 200, 100);

    fill(0, 0, 255);
    circle(200, 200, 100);
}
```

# Problem 4

Create a canvas with dimensions `480` x `320` and draw two overlapping rectangles. One rectangle should be filled with a red color and the other with a blue color. Both rectangles should have an opacity of `50%` (`125`).
