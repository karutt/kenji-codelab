In this chapter, we will learn about the basic concepts of programming.

First, let's talk about **variables**. Variables are like containers for storing data. By giving a name to a value and storing it, the code becomes easier to read, and by storing reusable values in variables, you can change them all at once. Additionally, by continuously updating the values stored in variables, you can express animations.

Next, we will learn about **syntax**. Syntax in programming refers to the rules and regulations that determine the structure of a program. For example, using **loops**, you can draw 100 circles at once. Also, by using **conditional branching**, you can draw those 100 circles alternately in black and white.

Through this chapter, let's learn the basics of variables and syntax and solidify the foundation of programming.
