# What is Programming?

Thank you for picking up this book. This book is written for students who are new to programming. It is aimed at those who are wondering, "What is programming?" and "How do I get started?"

First, programming is a way to tell a computer what you want it to do. Computers have high computational power and can do various things, but they won't work unless we give them correct instructions. So, we write a series of instructions called "code" to tell the computer what we want it to do. By writing code, we can command the computer to perform specific tasks.

# Programming Languages and Code

The language we use to write instructions for programming is called a "programming language." A programming language is a special language that allows us to communicate with computers. Just like Japanese or English, programming languages have their own rules and syntax. Instructions written according to these rules are called "code." Code is written in a way that computers can understand and execute.

In this book, we will use a programming language called "p5.js"[^1]. p5.js is a tool that makes it very easy and fun to learn programming. You can draw pictures, create animations, and make interactive works. It feels like drawing on a digital canvas while learning the basics of programming.

# Learning Programming

By learning programming, you will be able to create games, websites, and your own apps.

Additionally, as you tackle various problems and think about how to implement solutions, you will develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Programming is a powerful tool to express your ideas in the digital world.

Let's experience the fun and possibilities of programming together through this book!
