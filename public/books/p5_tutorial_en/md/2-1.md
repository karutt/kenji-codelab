In this section, you will learn how to draw basic shapes using p5.js. First, let's explain how to create a canvas for drawing.

# Creating a Canvas

In p5.js, you create a canvas for drawing using the `createCanvas` function. Let's try writing code in `sketch.js` to create a canvas with a width of 400 pixels and a height of 400 pixels.

```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background("#D6E3ED");
}
```

When you run this code, a 400x400 pixel canvas will be displayed in your browser.

# Using Drawing Functions

Now, let's draw shapes on the canvas we just created. p5.js provides convenient functions for drawing various shapes. Here are some basic drawing functions.

-   `line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`: Draws a line. `x1` and `y1` are the coordinates of the starting point, and `x2` and `y2` are the coordinates of the endpoint.
-   `circle(x, y, r)`: Draws a circle. `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the center of the circle, and `r` is the diameter.
-   `rect(x, y, w, h)`: Draws a rectangle. `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the top-left corner, `w` is the width, and `h` is the height.

Below is an example of drawing basic shapes using these functions.

```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background("#D6E3ED");
    // Draw a circle
    circle(200, 200, 300);
    // Draw a rectangle
    rect(150, 150, 100, 100);
    // Draw a line
    line(0, 0, 400, 400);
}
```

# Understanding the Coordinate System

Did you notice anything unusual about the coordinate specifications of the drawing functions? In fact, the coordinate system in p5.js is different from the Cartesian coordinate system you learn in math class. In the usual coordinate system, the origin (0,0) is at the bottom left, but in the **p5.js coordinate system (graphics coordinate system), the origin is at the top left**. This means that the x-coordinate increases as you go to the right, and the y-coordinate increases as you go down. The following diagram shows the difference between the two coordinate systems.

# List of p5.js Drawing Functions

In addition to `rect()`, `circle()`, and `line()`, p5.js provides various other drawing functions. Here are some of them.

| Function                                | Description                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ellipse(x, y, w, h)`                   | Draws an ellipse. `x` and `y` specify the center coordinates, `w` is the width, and `h` is the height.                        |
| `rect(x, y, w, h)`                      | Draws a rectangle. `x` and `y` specify the top-left corner coordinates, `w` is the width, and `h` is the height.             |
| `rect(x, y, w, h, r)`                   | Draws a rectangle with rounded corners. `r` specifies the radius of the rounded corners.                                     |
| `rect(x, y, w, h, tl, tr, br, bl)`      | Draws a rectangle with different rounded corners. `tl`, `tr`, `br`, and `bl` specify the radius of the top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left corners, respectively. |
| `line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`                  | Draws a line. `x1` and `y1` specify the starting point coordinates, and `x2` and `y2` specify the endpoint coordinates.      |
| `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)`      | Draws a triangle. Specifies the coordinates of the three vertices.                                                           |
| `quad(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4)`  | Draws a quadrilateral. Specifies the coordinates of the four vertices.                                                       |
| `arc(x, y, w, h, start, stop)`          | Draws an arc. `x` and `y` specify the center coordinates, `w` is the width, `h` is the height, and `start` and `stop` specify the angles. |
| `point(x, y)`                           | Draws a point. `x` and `y` specify the coordinates of the point.                                                             |
