# User Events

User events are actions performed by users on a web page. For example, mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, and scrolling are all user events. In this section, we will learn about common user events in p5.js.

# Triggering Actions on the Computer

We mainly use two devices to trigger actions on a computer:

1. Mouse
2. Keyboard

For example, when you press a button on a web page, you use the mouse to click it. When you enter text in a search box, you use the keyboard to type.

p5.js provides functions to detect actions from these devices. In programming, actions triggered by users on a computer are called **events**.

# Mouse Events

Let's consider what happens when you click on a circle.

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
    background(220);
    circle(200, 200, 100);
}

function mouseClicked() {
    if (dist(mouseX, mouseY, 200, 200) < 50) {
        fill(255, 0, 0);
    }
}
```
