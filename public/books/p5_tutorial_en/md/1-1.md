# Setting Up Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

In this section, we will explain the necessary VSCode settings to start programming with p5.js. We assume that VSCode is already installed.

# 1. Installing Plugins

To use p5.js effectively in VSCode, install the following plugins. You can install plugins from the VSCode extension marketplace.

1. **P5 Snippets and Tools**: Provides snippets and tools for p5.js.
2. **live-p5**: Provides live preview for p5.js sketches.
3. **Live Preview**: Allows real-time preview of HTML files.
4. **Prettier - Code formatter**: Automatically formats your code.
5. **Code Runner**: A plugin that allows you to easily run code.

Refer to the image below for the plugin installation method.

### To Enable Code Runner

:::message
To use the Code Runner plugin, you need to install Node.js. Follow the steps below to install Node.js.
:::

1. Access the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) and download the installer.

3. Once the installation is complete, restart VSCode.

# 2. Configuring Settings.json

Adjust the user settings in VSCode to make coding more comfortable. Add the following settings to the User Settings.json.

1. Open VSCode settings (`Ctrl + ,` or `Cmd + ,`).
2. Click the `{}` icon at the top right of the settings screen to open the settings file (settings.json).
3. Add the following settings.

```json
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "editor.tabSize": 4,
    "prettier.tabWidth": 4
}
```

# 3. Creating a p5.js Working Folder

First, create a folder for your p5.js project. Follow the steps below to create the folder.

1. Navigate to the `students` folder.
2. Create a new folder named `p5js`.

The folder structure will be as follows:

```
|- students
  |- p5js
```

3. Open the `p5js` folder in VSCode. With VSCode open, press `Ctrl + K` and then `Ctrl + O`, and select the `p5js` folder to open it.

# 4. Running Your First Code

Assuming you have completed all the previous steps and have the `p5js` folder open in VSCode, we will proceed. The following steps for "Creating a p5.js Project" and "Displaying the p5.js Live Preview" are steps you will perform each time you create a new project, so make sure to remember them.

## Creating a p5.js Project

1. Open the command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P`.
2. Type `Create a standard p5.js project` (you can type `create` and the command will appear in the suggestions). Select the command by pressing Enter.

3. Select `Yes` for `Do you want to create a new directory?`.
4. In the next input form, set the new folder name to `01_first_sketch`.
5. For `Do you want to use a local or a hosted version?`, select `Hosted` to complete the creation of the new p5.js project.

This will add a folder named `01_first_sketch`. Confirm that the folder named `01_first_sketch` is displayed in the left folder panel of VSCode.

## Displaying the p5.js Live Preview

Click the `01_first_sketch` folder and open the `sketch.js` file inside to view the code.

Next, open the command palette again with `Ctrl + Shift + P`, type `Open live p5 panel`, and press Enter to select the command. This will display the p5.js live view in the right panel.

Try changing the line `background(220)` in the `sketch.js` code to `background(255, 0, 0)`. If the display in the right panel turns red, it was successful!
