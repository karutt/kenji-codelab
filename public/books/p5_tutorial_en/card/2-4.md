# What is a Variable?

Please explain what a "variable" is. What are the benefits of using variables?

- ⚪︎ To store data for calculations and reuse
- A tool to delete data
- A function to draw shapes
- Code to perform specific calculations

## Explanation

A variable is like a "box" in a program that stores data for reuse. By using variables, you can update the value throughout the program by changing it in one place, improving code readability and maintainability.

# Declaring Variables

Choose the variable declaration method that causes an error in the following code.

```js
let radius = 120;
let number1 = 100;
let 2number = 50;
```

- ⚪︎ `let 2number = 50;`
- `let number1 = 100;`
- `let radius = 120;`
- None of them cause an error

## Explanation

Variable names cannot start with a number or contain special characters. Names like `2number` or `✞BlackWing✞` are invalid.

# Built-in Variables

What do the built-in p5.js variables `width` and `height` represent?

- ⚪︎ The width and height of the canvas
- The color and transparency of shapes
- The position of the window
- The position of mouse clicks

## Explanation

`width` and `height` are built-in p5.js variables that represent the width and height of the canvas. The size set by `createCanvas()` is assigned to these variables.

# Declaring Variables with `let`

Which of the following is the correct way to declare a variable?

- ⚪︎ `let x = 100;`
- `let x == 100;`
- `x = 100;`
- `var x = 100;`

## Explanation

Declare a variable using `let` and assign a value. `var` is an older way of declaring variables, and using `let` is recommended.

# Updating Variables

What will be the final value of the variable `x` in the following code?

```js
let x = 120;
x = x + 20;
x = x - 40;
```

- ⚪︎ `100`
- `140`
- `180`
- `160`

## Explanation

The initial value of `x` is `120`. `x = x + 20` makes it `140`, and `x = x - 40` makes it `100`.

# Arithmetic Operations

What will be the value of the variable `z` in the following code?

```js
let z = 12 / 2 + 4 * 2;
```

- ⚪︎ `14`
- `4`
- `20`
- `1.2`

## Explanation

Due to the order of operations, `4 * 2` is calculated first, resulting in `8`, and then `10 + 8` is calculated to get `14`.

# Assignment Operators

Choose the correct assignment operator to update the value of `x` in the following code.

```js
let x = 50;
x = x + 30;
```

- ⚪︎ `x += 30;`
- `x =+ 30;`
- `x == 30;`
- `x = x ++ 30;`

## Explanation

`x += 30;` is the same as `x = x + 30;`. This is a shorthand using the assignment operator.

# Special Operators `++` and `--`

What will be the final value of the variable `y` in the following code?

```js
let y = 10;
y++;
y--;
y += 5;
```

- `14`
- `12`
- `11`
- ⚪︎ `15`

## Explanation

`y++` makes it `11`, `y--` brings it back to `10`, and `y += 5` makes it `15`.

# Code to Draw a Circle in the Center

Choose the correct expression to calculate the value of `y` in the following code.

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    let y = ____; // Calculate the Y coordinate of the center of the canvas
    circle(200, y, 50);
}
```

- ⚪︎ `height / 2`
- `width / 2`
- `height`
- `width`

## Explanation

To draw a circle in the center of the canvas, you need the vertical center coordinate. `height / 2` calculates the center Y coordinate.

# More Efficient Code Writing

Explain the benefits of using variables instead of directly specifying values, as shown in the following code.

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 240);
    let radius = 120;
    circle(80, 120, radius);
    circle(200, 120, radius);
    circle(320, 120, radius);
}
```

- ⚪︎ You can affect the entire code by changing one place
- Execution speed increases
- Errors will never occur
- Functions are no longer needed

## Explanation

Using variables allows you to change values in bulk, making code maintenance easier. It is especially useful when the same value is used in multiple places.
