# `createCanvas()`

What is the role of the `createCanvas()` function?

- ⚪︎ To create a canvas
- To delete a canvas
- To set a color
- To enlarge a canvas

## Explanation

The `createCanvas()` function is used to set up the drawing area. Without specifying the drawing area using this function, nothing will be drawn.

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}
```

# p5.js Coordinate System

Where is the origin located in the p5.js coordinate system?

- ⚪︎ Top left
- Top right
- Bottom left
- Bottom right

## Explanation

The p5.js coordinate system, like the browser's coordinate system, has its origin at the top left. This is different from the typical mathematical coordinate system.

# Arguments

What are the arguments of a function?

- ⚪︎ Values passed to a function
- The return value of a function
- The name of a function
- The content of a function

## Explanation

Arguments are values passed to a function. The function receives these arguments and uses them to perform its operations. For example, the `circle()` function takes three arguments: the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and diameter, and draws a circle at the specified position.

```js
circle(200, 200, 100); // Draws a circle with a diameter of 100 at position x:200, y:200
```

# `fill()` Function

What do the four arguments of the `fill()` function represent?

- ⚪︎ `fill(red, green, blue, alpha);`
- `fill(green, red, blue, alpha);`
- `fill(blue, red, green, alpha);`
- `fill(alpha, red, green, blue);`

## Explanation

The `fill()` function specifies the color used to fill shapes. The arguments are red, green, blue, and alpha (opacity). Each argument ranges from 0 to 255. The alpha value ranges from 0 (transparent) to 255 (opaque). For example, to draw a semi-transparent red circle, you would write:

```js
fill(255, 0, 0, 100);
```

# Drawing Order

What color will the visible circle be in the following code?

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background('#F1F5F9');

    fill(255, 0, 0);
    circle(200, 200, 100);

    fill(0, 0, 255);
    circle(200, 200, 100);
}
```

- ⚪︎ Blue
- Red
- Green
- Black

## Explanation

In p5.js, shapes drawn later will overwrite shapes drawn earlier. Therefore, in this code, the blue circle will be drawn over the red circle, making the visible circle blue.

# `rect()` Function

What do the four arguments of the `rect()` function represent?

- ⚪︎ `rect(x, y, width, height);`
- `rect(x, y, height, width);`
- `rect(width, height, x, y);`
- `rect(height, width, x, y);`

## Explanation

The `rect()` function draws a rectangle. The arguments are the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width, and height. The x and y coordinates specify the position of the top-left corner of the rectangle, and the width and height specify the size of the rectangle.

# `noStroke()` and `strokeWeight()` Functions

How many arguments do the `noStroke()` and `strokeWeight()` functions take?

- ⚪︎ `noStroke()`: 0, `strokeWeight()`: 1
- `noStroke()`: 1, `strokeWeight()`: 0
- `noStroke()`: 1, `strokeWeight()`: 1
- `noStroke()`: 0, `strokeWeight()`: 0

## Explanation

The `noStroke()` function hides the outline of shapes and takes no arguments. The `strokeWeight()` function sets the thickness of the outline and takes one argument.

```js
noStroke(); // Hides the outline
strokeWeight(2); // Sets the outline thickness to 2
```

# `beginShape()`, `vertex()`, `endShape()` Functions

What is the purpose of the `beginShape()`, `vertex()`, and `endShape()` functions?

- ⚪︎ To draw arbitrary shapes
- To draw rectangles
- To draw circles
- To draw lines

## Explanation

The `beginShape()` and `endShape(CLOSE)` functions allow you to draw arbitrary shapes by specifying vertices between them. This enables the creation of more complex shapes and paths. For example, to draw an equilateral triangle, you would write:

```js
beginShape();
vertex(200, 100);
vertex(100, 273.3);
vertex(300, 273.3);
endShape(CLOSE);
```
